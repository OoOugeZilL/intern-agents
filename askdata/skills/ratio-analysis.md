# ratio-analysis

## Description
Compute the ratio between two groups or categories. Return the count/value for each group and the ratio as a decimal or percentage.

## When to Use
- "What is the ratio of X to Y?"
- "What percentage of total does X represent?"
- "How many X per Y?"
- "Compare the proportion of A vs B"

## SQL Pattern
```sql
SELECT
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN <condition_for_group_a> THEN <value_or_1> ELSE 0 END) AS REAL)
    / NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN <condition_for_group_b> THEN <value_or_1> ELSE 0 END), 0) AS ratio,
  SUM(CASE WHEN <condition_for_group_a> THEN <value_or_1> ELSE 0 END) AS group_a_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN <condition_for_group_b> THEN <value_or_1> ELSE 0 END) AS group_b_count
FROM <table>
```

## Example
Question: "What is the ratio of customers who pay in EUR against customers who pay in CZK?"
```sql
SELECT
  CAST(SUM(IIF(Currency = 'EUR', 1, 0)) AS FLOAT)
    / NULLIF(SUM(IIF(Currency = 'CZK', 1, 0)), 0) AS ratio,
  SUM(IIF(Currency = 'EUR', 1, 0)) AS eur_customers,
  SUM(IIF(Currency = 'CZK', 1, 0)) AS czk_customers
FROM customers
```
